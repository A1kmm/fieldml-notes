# List of incremental change proposals based off this proposal
# Abstract
This proposal aims to be a proposal for a future version of FieldML that makes no attempt to be minor or incremental; the idea is to demonstrate what direction we should aim for, rather than what software could implement quickly with minimal changes.

# Core syntactic concepts
- Namespaces
- Domains
    - CloneDomain
- Fields
    - InbuiltField
    - MathematicalField

# Namespaces
## Concepts
Objects (fields, domains, etc...) have identifiers in zero or more namespaces. Only one object can use each name in each namespace; different objects cannot have the same identifier in the same namespace, even if they are of different types.

Namespaces are themselves objects, and so can have identifiers in other namespaces.

Namespaces can be explicitly declared, but they are also created implicitly by various syntactic constructs. For example, every domain and every field is also a namespace.

The namespacing scheme is used solely to name and access objects; being in a namespace does not imply anything about how the fields should be computed, nor about the semantic meaning of the contents of each namespace.

An identifier becomes a member of a namespace by:
  1. being declared within the syntactic range of that namespace, or,
  2. being imported into that namespace using an import statement (as defined below).

## Paths
A path is the term used for a reference to a symbol; they are part of the syntax of the language, and the meaning depends on the position in the file in which they appear. However, once a path has been resolved to an object, the path has no further effect on the interpretation.

A number of path types are possible:
- Relative paths. Relative paths shown in this document begin with an identifier segment. This first identifier segment is looked up by starting in the namespace in which the path appears, and looking for the identifier. If it is not found, the namespace which is syntactically the parent of the namespace is checked, and so on until the identifier is found or the root namespace in the file has been checked. Once an identifier matching the first segment is found, each subsequent segment is looked up in the namespace found by matching the previous segment.
- Absolute paths. Absolute paths shown in this document begin with ::, and then have a relative path. Such paths indicate that the object should be found by starting at the root namespace of the current file, and resolving the relative path from the root rather than the context namespace in which the path appears.

### Examples
    object myO -- First O object
    namespace A where
      object myO -- Second O object
      namespace B where
        object myO -- Third O object
        namespace C where
          valid-path myO -- Refers to 'Third O object'.
          valid-path ::myO -- Refers to 'First O object'.
          valid-path A::myO -- Refers to 'Second O object'.
          valid-path A::B::myO -- Refers to 'Third O object'.
          invalid-path ::B::myO -- Invalid, no B in top-level.
    namespace D where
      valid-path A -- Refers to the namespace.
      valid-path A::B::myO -- Third O object.

## Imports
The import statement carries the following information:

    Import from *URL* *namespacePath* (*listOfSymbols*) hiding (*listOfSymbols*) as *localid*

The "as *localid*" is optional - if present, it is a synonym for declaring a namespace localid and placing the import without it. e.g.

    Import from "http://example.org/mymodel.xml" Test::MyNamespace as MyTest

is a synonym for:

    namespace MyTest where
      Import from "http://example.org/mymodel.xml" Test::MyNamespace

Either form takes all symbols from namespace Test::MyNamespace in http://example.org/mymodel.xml and puts them in local namespace MyTest.

The "from *URL*" may be omitted, in which case the import refers to the current file. If "from *URL*" is not omitted, *namespacePath* may either be a relative or an absolute path, and is interpreted relative to the current position. If "from *URL*" is present, *namespacePath* may either be a relative or an absolute path, but it will always be interpreted relative to the root.

The first (*listOfSymbols*) is optional; if present, it lists the symbols to import, but if absent, all symbols not explicitly hidden are imported.

The "hiding (*listOfSymbols*)" is also optional, and may only be present if the first (*listOfSymbols*) is omitted. It lists symbols not to import.

Each member of a *listOfSymbols* must be an individual name to import; it cannot be a path. Symbols are separated by ,.

An identifier that is imported into a namespace behaves in exactly the same way as an identifier that was defined in the namespace in all respects; there are merely two names for the same thing.

# Domains

## Abstract conceptual domain

A domain is an abstract object (i.e. cannot be declared directly without using one of the more specialised domains) that has a conceptual (and possibly infinite) sets called the label set and the value set. There is a surjective relationship between the label set and the value set; in other words, every value has at least one label, the same value can have labels, but the same label cannot have multiple values.

The fact that two values are members of the same domain, or are members of different domains, does not imply anything about the physical meanings of those values; that interpretation can instead be supplied from other context such as comments or metadata in the file about the physical meaning.

Instead, the domains exists to constrain what conversions will happen automatically, and to specify how the conversions occur, to reduce the risk of modeller error. They play a synonymous role to what type systems do in programming languages; much of the theory for domain inference is borrowed from Hindley-Milner type inference.

The choice of when to use a different domain (for example, using the clone facilities discussed below), and when to use the same domain is one for the modeller, and there are significant questions of degree that feed into that decision. For example, it might make sense to make the X, Y, and Z axes in a 3 dimensional space their own domains, but in a 10,000 dimensional problem, or in a problem where the dimensionality is unknown, the modeller is unlikely to be writing the model in terms of explicitly named dimensions, and so there would be little benefit in creating a separate domain for each dimension.

The language is entirely statically typed and monomorphic with respect to domain. This means that every single field in a file has a domain type signature. Type variables are allowed (as discussed below) in fields that exist purely to support other fields, but only fields containing no type variables can actually appear in fields that can be evaluated.

Every domain is implicitly also a namespace.

## Point domain
There is a built in domain called the Point domain. It can be referred to from anywhere as a matter of syntax, without any need to import. It is also referred to as {} within this document, because of its special relationship to the Product domain.

It has one label and one value; this is referred to as {} within this document.

## Reals domain
There is a built in domain called the Reals domain. It can be referred to from anywhere as a matter of syntax, without any need to import.

Literal numbers, represented as a series of digits, optionally followed by a decimal point and more digits, are treated as built-in fields from Point onto values of the Reals domain.

## Clone domain
A clone domain creates a new domain from an existing domain. The point space will be of identical cardinality, the label space will be the same, and the mapping from point to label space will correspond exactly.

    Import from "http://fieldml.org/library/builtin" :: (Reals)
    CloneDomain XMetres from Reals
    CloneDomain YMetres from Reals

In the above example, XMetres and YMetres are new domains which may take the same values as Reals can. A value of XMetres can be implicitly converted to a value of Reals, but a value of Reals cannot be implicitly converted to a value of XMetres. A value of XMetres cannot be converted implicitly to a value of YMetres.

A CloneDomain implicitly imports everything 

The special operator asclone C (where C is a path to a CloneDomain) produces a field 

    asclone C :: WhatCWasClonedFrom -> C

The special operator unclone C (where C is a path to a CloneDomain) produces a field

    unclone C :: C -> WhatCWasClonedFrom

For example, where . denotes domain composition:

    f :: SomeDomain -> XMetres
    -- Some definition for f here.
    g :: SomeDomain -> YMetres
    -- You could write it like this:
    g = (asclone YMetres) . (unclone XMetres) . f
    -- but the unclone is unnecessary in this case, since XMetres can be converted to Reals implicitly:
    g = (asclone XMetres) . f
    -- The following would be invalid, because it is trying to convert XMetres to YMetres implicitly.
    g = f

## Ensemble domain

An ensemble domain is a set of labelled points; defining an ensemble defines both the labels and a disjoint union domain (see below) set that can take any value from that set.

In this document, a new ensemble domain E is denoted as:

    E = Ensemble label1 label2 label3

Alternative, Ensembles with labels that are a range of numbers can be defined as:

    E = Ensemble 10..100

The labels become members of the namespace E, and the domain E can be used as if it was a disjoint union domain over those labels.

In addition to explicitly declare ensemble domains, every domain has an implicit anonymous ensemble containing only one label. There is no way to reference this ensemble as a domain, but the labels can be referenced simply by using the domain name in a context where a label is expected. In the above example, E::label1 is a label in domain E, and E is a label in an anonymous domain. This specification has been designed so there can never be any ambiguity between the domain E and the label E.

Note: Boolean is a built in Ensemble domain that is available using the phrase 'Boolean' in any scope. It has labels True and False, which are also universally available.

## Product domain

The product domain makes a domain which has as its value space the cartesian product of the value space of the parts, and as the label space, has the cartesian product of the label spaces of the parts. Each part has a named label. The labels must be scoped, and must have previously been defined using Ensemble domain constructors. It is not necessary that all labels were originally defined in the same ensemble.

If you declare the exact same product domain twice (i.e. with the exact same labels and domains, where labels are determined to be the same by what label reference rather than by string comparison), you get an indistinguishable domain which can be used interchangeably.

In this document, the syntax { label1: domain1, label2: domain2, label3: domain3 } is used for product domains. The product domain over nothing ({}) is indistinguishable from the point domain. It is possible to define a product domain of only one thing, { label1: domain1 }. This is not identical to domain1, because it has a label (but can be converted, as discussed in another section).

If you omit one or more labels, the default is the label that was defined implicitly for the domain.

Examples:

    SpaceAxes = Ensemble X Y Z
    XMetres = CloneDomain Reals
    YMetres = CloneDomain Reals
    ZMetres = CloneDomain Reals
    # Explicitly labelling spatial points...
    SpatialPoints = { SpaceAxes::X : XMetres, SpaceAxes::Y : YMetres, SpaceAxes::Z : ZMetres }
    # An alternative (but incompatible for conversion) definition:
    SpatialPoints2 = { XMetres, YMetres, ZMetres}
    # This is equivalent (and compatible for conversion) to:
    SpatialPoints3 = { XMetres : XMetres, YMetres : YMetres, ZMetres : ZMetres}
    # Now we can extend it to a new dimension; see the conversion rules to understand the utility of this.
    TimeAxis = Ensemble T
    TSeconds = CloneDomain Reals
    SpaceTimePoints = { SpaceAxes::X : XMetres, SpaceAxes::Y : YMetres, SpaceAxes::Z : ZMetres, TimeAxis::T : TSeconds }
    # Alternatively (but incompatibly)...
    SpaceTimePoints2 = { SpatialPoints, TimeAxis::T : TSeconds }

## The disjoint union domain

The disjoint union domain constructor creates a domain where every point is associated with exactly one label, and the remaining data carried by the point is determined by the label; in other words, the space of the disjoint union is the union of the spaces of all the constituent parts after a label is attached to all the points in each constituent domain to make the constituent domains disjoint.

New disjoint union domains are denoted here using the following notation:

    D = ( label1 : domain1 | label2 : domain2 | label3 : domain3 )

If you declare the exact same disjoint union domain twice (i.e. with the exact same labels and domains, where labels are determined to be the same by what label reference rather than by string comparison), you get an indistinguishable domain which can be used interchangeably. Note that this applies between the disjoint union domains defined using Ensemble as well (for an Ensemble, the domain corresponding to every label is {}).

If you omit one or more labels, the default is the label that was defined implicitly for the domain.

Examples:

    # Identical domain to (compatible with for conversion) SpaceAxes.
    SpaceAxes2 = (SpaceAxes::X : {} | SpaceAxes::Y : {} | SpaceAxes::Z : {})
    Dimensions = (SpaceAxes::X : {} | SpaceAxes::Y : {} | SpaceAxes::Z : {} | TimeAxis::T : {})
    # The domain of point on any axis line (except it includes points at 0 on one axis as being different to points at 0 on another axis... this can be fixed using concepts introduced later).
    PointsOnAxes = (XMetres | YMetres | ZMetres | TSeconds)

## ConnectDomain

ConnectDomain shrinks the point space of the domain, while keeping the label space of the domain the same, meaning that there might be multiple labels for one point. No implication is made about derivative continuity at this stage (a separate construct is needed, but until such a construct is provided, it is the responsibility of the user to ensure expressions involving derivatives are appropriate).

In this document, the following notation is used to define a new domain E by changing the connectivity of D, using fields $f1, ..., f_n$.

    E = ConnectDomain D using [f1, f2, f3]

Each field $f_i$ must map from a subset of D, $S_i \subseteq D$ to D. The $f_i$ fields must not produce output values in $\bigcap_{i=1}^n S_i$. The meaning is that if $l_1$ and $l_2$ are two point labels in E, they are the same point if $l_1 = l_2$ or if $f_i(l_1) = f_j(l_2)$ for some i, j.

For example, we can use the ConnectDomain to fix the issue mentioned above where the previous attempt to define PointsOnAxes treats (XMetres 0) as a different point to (YMetres 0):

    # We use 'where' syntax to put things in the PointsOnAxes namespace...
    PointsOnAxes = ConnectDomain PointsOnAxes' using canonicaliseZeroes where
      # Define the starting domain as above...
      PointsOnAxes' = (XMetres | YMetres | ZMetres | TSeconds)
      # Define a field 'norm' giving the norm of the point using notation not introduced yet.
      norm :: PointOnAxes' -> PointOnAxes'
      norm (XMetres x) = x
      norm (XMetres y) = y
      norm (XMetres z) = z
      # Define a domain for a zero point, using notation not introduced yet:
      ZeroPoint = SubsetDomain PointsOnAxes' using isZeroPoint where
        # Define a field (using notation not introduced yet)
        isZeroPoint :: PointsOnAxes' -> Boolean
        isZeroPoint x = norm x == 0
      # Define a field (using notation not introduced yet)
      canonicaliseZeroes :: ZeroPoint -> PointsOnAxes'
      canonicaliseZeroes x = XMetres 0

## SubsetDomain

A SubsetDomain defines a domain which is a subset of another domain, using a boolean function over the original domain that evaluates to True if the point is to be included, and False otherwise.

The following syntax is used in this document to declare a SubsetDomain E from D using boolean field f:

    E = SubsetDomain D using f

## EmbedDomain

EmbedDomain defines a new domain from another domain, adding the property that it can be transformed to another particular domain. The EmbedDomain does not change the existing domains in any way; the only effect is the creation of the new domain.

Example:

    RealMillimetres = EmbedDomain Reals in RealMetres using f where
      f :: Reals -> RealMetres
      f x = x / 1000

## Field signature domain

A field signature domain is the domain of all possible mappings between a domain and a codomain. It is represented using the following notation:

    (Domain -> Codomain)

For example, it can be used to define a vector of 100 elements:

    ElID = Ensemble 1..100
    HundredD = (ElID -> Reals)

## Domain type parameters

Any domain can be defined using one or more type parameters. For example, in the below, a is a type parameter, and the modeller can re-use HundredOf to refer to vectors of a hundred real, matrices that consist of a hundred vectors of real, or any other value of 'a':

    HundredOf a = (ElID -> a)

A domain with no type parameters is said to have kind *. A domain with one type parameter has kind (* -> *), and so on. A type parameter may be removed by applying a concrete type to a type parameter, simply by concatenating the type to be applied to the end. For example:

    MyVector = CloneDomain X where
                 X = HundredOf Real # HundredOf has kind * -> *, but HundredOf Real has kind *

Note that type parameters can be used for static polymorphism, but they cannot be used for run-time type polymorphism. In this sense, they are like templates in C++ and type parameters in Haskell.

## Domain classes

Sometimes, it is useful to say that a number of domains (or a number of pairs or triples or so on) have some property in common; this may either be a domain or a field that can be retrieved for each such domain / pair / triple.

For example, it might be useful to define a class of domains for which it is possible to check for equality. This is done by firstly defining a class, and then specifying that certain domains are members using an instance:

    class Eq a where
      # Every member of the class Eq must provide isEqual
      isEqual :: { 0 : a, 1 : a } -> Boolean
      # Note: no definition is provided above, only the signature.
      notEqual :: { 0 : a, 1 : a } -> Boolean
      # Here we provide a default implementation in terms of other class fields. It is still possible to override on 
      # instances.
      notEqual args = not (isEqual args)

    # Now we define how Eq works for Real.
    instance Eq Reals where
      isEqual { 0 : x, 1 : y } = x == y # A bit circular here - probably this would be built in.

We might then use it to define a metric...

    class Metric a where
       domain DistanceDomain
       distance :: { 0 : a, 1 : a } -> DistanceDomain
    L2Real = CloneDomain Real
    instance Metric L2Real where
       DistanceDomain = Real
       distance { 0 : x, 1 : y } = (x-y)^2

Field signatures and class signatures involving type parameters may include class constraints on the type parameters in the instance head, by prefixing class constraints before '=>'. For example:

    TriplePosition = Ensemble Start Middle End
    isEquispace :: (Metric a, Eq ((Metric a)::DistanceDomain)) => { TriplePosition::Start : a, TriplePosition::Middle : a, TriplePosition::End : a } -> Boolean
    isEquispace {TriplePosition::Start = s, TriplePosition::Middle = m, TriplePosition::End = e} =
      isEqual {0=(Metric::distance {0=s, 1=m}), 1=(Metric::distance {0=m, 1=e})}

# Fields
## Fields in general

A field is a mapping from a domain to a codomain. They are synonymous with some other mathematical concepts: with functions, but also, in the case of fields with an ensemble domain and a scalar codomain, with vectors.

It must be possible to compute, using the type inference rules defined below, a field signature domain corresponding to every field. This signature can be provided directly as a constraint on the type inference engine:

    f :: Real -> Real

## Inbuilt fields
The following special keywords allow fields that are implicitly defined to be referenced. The keywords are not, by themselves, fields.

### The identity field

The symbol id (possibly defined in a library, but useful for definitions, so included here as a builtin) is a field that returns whatever is passed into it.

### The lookup field

If l is a label on a product domain, then

    lookup l

is a field with field signature (a -> b) valid over a in the class of product domains that have a member with label l; b is determined from a as the domain matching label l in domain a.

### The append field

If l is a label on a product domain, then

  append l

is a field with field signature ({ product: a, add: b} -> c) valid over a in the class of product domains that do not have a member with label l. The domain of c is constrained to be the product domain of the same type as a except with an additional member with label l and domain matching the domain of b. The semantics are that a is modified to add b.

### The merge field

The following predefined field exists:

    merge

with field signature ({ 0 : a, 1 : b } -> c), valid over a and b in the class of product domains that do not have any labels in common. The type of c is determined from a and b to be the product domain that includes all labelled values from either of the arguments.

### The label field

The following predefined field exists:

    label

with field signature (a -> b), valid over a in the class of disjoint union domains. The domain b is determined from a as the disjoint union of all the labels in a with the point domain.

### The unionValue field

The following predefined field exists:

    unionValue

with field signature (a -> b), valid over a in the class of disjoint union domains which are homogeneous in the sense that the domain associated with every label is the same.
